# AWARE: Rotation

[![Swift Package Manager compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)


This sensor module allows us to access the **rotation rate** of the device. A rotation data contains data specifying the deviceâ€™s rate of rotation around three axes. The value of this property contains a measurement of gyroscope data whose bias has been removed by Core Motion algorithms. Please check the link below for details.

## Requirements
iOS 13 or later


## Installation

You can integrate this framework into your project via Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) or CocoaPods.

### SwiftPM
1. Open Package Manager Windows
    * Open `Xcode` -> Select `Menu Bar` -> `File` -> `App Package Dependencies...` 

2. Find the package using the manager
    * Select `Search Package URL` and type `git@github.com:awareframework/com.awareframework.ios.sensor.rotation.git`

3. Import the package into your target.

4. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.rotation library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_rotation
```

### CocoaPods

com.awareframework.ios.sensor.rotation is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). 

1. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'com.awareframework.ios.sensor.rotation'
```

2. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.rotation library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_rotation
```

## Public functions
### RotationSensor

+ `init(config:RotationSensor.Config?)` : Initializes the rotation sensor with the optional configuration.
+ `start()`: Starts the rotation sensor with the optional configuration.
+ `stop()`: Stops the service.

### RotationSensor.Config

Class to hold the configuration of the sensor.

#### Fields
+ `sensorObserver: RotationObserver`: Callback for live data updates.
+ `frequency: Int`: Data samples to collect per second (Hz). (default = 5)
+ `period: Double`: Period to save data in minutes. (default = 1)
+ `threshold: Double`: If set, do not record consecutive points if change in value is less than the set value.
+ `enabled: Boolean` Sensor is enabled or not. (default = `false`)
+ `debug: Boolean` enable/disable logging to Xcode console. (default = `false`)
+ `label: String` Label for the data. (default = "")
+ `deviceId: String` Id of the device that will be associated with the events and the sensor. (default = "")
+ `dbEncryptionKey` Encryption key for the database. (default = `null`)
+ `dbType: Engine` Which db engine to use for saving data. (default = `Engine.DatabaseType.NONE`)
+ `dbPath: String` Path of the database. (default = "aware_rotation")
+ `dbHost: String` Host for syncing the database. (default = `null`)

## Broadcasts

### Fired Broadcasts

+ `RotationSensor.ACTION_AWARE_ROTATION` fired when rotation saved data to db after the period ends.

### Received Broadcasts

+ `RotationSensor.ACTION_AWARE_ROTATION_START`: received broadcast to start the sensor.
+ `RotationSensor.ACTION_AWARE_ROTATION_STOP`: received broadcast to stop the sensor.
+ `RotationSensor.ACTION_AWARE_ROTATION_SYNC`: received broadcast to send sync attempt to the host.
+ `RotationSensor.ACTION_AWARE_ROTATION_SET_LABEL`: received broadcast to set the data label. Label is expected in the ``RotationSensor.EXTRA_LABEL` field of the intent extras.

## Data Representations

### `Rotation Data

Contains the raw sensor data.

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                     |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| x         | Double  | value of X axis                                                 |
| y         | Double  | value of Y axis                                                 |
| z         | Double  | value of Z axis                                                 |
| label     | String | Customizable label. Useful for data calibration or traceability |
| deviceId  | String | AWARE device UUID                                               |
| label     | String | Customizable label. Useful for data calibration or traceability |
| timestamp | Int64   | unixtime milliseconds since 1970                                |
| timezone  | Int    | Raw timezone offset of the device                          |
| os        | String | Operating system of the device (ex. ios)                    |



## Example usage
```swift
// Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
let rotationSensor = RotationSensor.init(RotationSensor.Config().apply{ config in
    config.sensorObserver = Observer()
    config.debug = true
})
rotationSensor?.start()
```

```swift
class Observer:RotationObserver{
    func onDataChanged(data: RotationData) {
        // Your code here..
    }
}
```
